# jar-copier

A Leiningen plugin to copy a jar from your dependencies into your resources. This is necesarry in the case of Java
agents for example, which have to be present as jars outside the uberjar.

## Usage

Put `[jar-copier "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector on your `project.clj`. To run this plug in, execute:

    $ lein jar-copier

If you want the task to run automatically, which is recommended, add:

    :prep-tasks ["javac" "compile" "jar-copier"]

and it'll be invoked every time you build your uberjar.

You need to configure the plug-in in your `project.clj` like this:

    :jar-copier {:java-agents true
                 :destination "resources/jars"}

`:java-agents` instruct this plug in to automatically copy any jars that are specified as Java agents. `:destination`
specifies where to copy them to.

For example, from [proclodo-spa-server-rendering](https://github.com/ldnclj/proclodo-spa-server-rendering):

    (defproject proclodo-spa-server-rendering "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]]
      :plugins [[jar-copier "0.1.0"]]
      :prep-tasks ["javac" "compile" "jar-copier"]
      :java-agents [[com.newrelic.agent.java/newrelic-agent "3.20.0"]]
      :jar-copier {:java-agents true
                   :destination "resources/jars"})

## TODO

This plug in only copies jars specified as java agents but there's potential for more. See:
