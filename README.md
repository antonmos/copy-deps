# jar-copier

[jar-copier](https://carouselapps.com/jar-copier/) is a Leiningen plugin to copy a jar from your dependencies into your
resources. This is necessary in the case of Java agents for example, which have to be present as jars outside the uberjar.

## Usage

In your `project.clj`, in the `:plugins` section, add:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/jar-copier/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/jar-copier)

To run this plug in, execute:

    $ lein jar-copier

If you want the task to run automatically, which is recommended, add:

    :prep-tasks ["javac" "compile" "jar-copier"]

and it'll be invoked every time you build your uberjar.

You need to configure the plug-in in your `project.clj` like this:

    :jar-copier {:java-agents true
                 :destination "resources/jars"}

`:java-agents` instruct this plug in to automatically copy any jars that are specified as Java agents. `:destination`
specifies where to copy them to.

For example, from [proclodo-spa-server-rendering](https://github.com/ldnclj/proclodo-spa-server-rendering):

    (defproject proclodo-spa-server-rendering "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]]
      :plugins [[jar-copier "0.1.0"]]
      :prep-tasks ["javac" "compile" "jar-copier"]
      :java-agents [[com.newrelic.agent.java/newrelic-agent "3.20.0"]]
      :jar-copier {:java-agents true
                   :destination "resources/jars"})

## To Do

This plug in only copies jars specified as java agents but there's potential for more. See:
